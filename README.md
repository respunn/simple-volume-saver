# Volume Control Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension allows users to control the volume of videos and audios on web pages. The extension provides several features like adjusting volume through a slider, muting/unmuting, and saving volume settings for specific sites.

## Features:
+ Volume Slider: Adjust the volume of the media (audio/video) elements on the active page.
+ Mute/Unmute: Toggle the mute state for the media elements.
+ Save Site Settings: Save volume settings for specific sites, so that they persist across sessions.
+ Reset Volume: Reset the volume to 100% or saved value.
+ Remove Sites: Remove saved volume settings for specific sites.

## TODO:
+ Jump to any tab that is playing audio with just one click ()
+ Boost the volume up to 300% (Maybe IDK?)
+ ~~Add extra bass to your music with a bass boost feature~~ (Won't be made.)
+ Complete UI overhaul (In-Progress)
+ ~~Dark mode~~

## Known issues:
+ If there is new media playing on Instagram media volume resets to 100.
+ ~~Sometimes percentage shows very long numbers after the point.~~
+ ~~Percentage text moves with input.~~
+ ~~Reset button not setting volume to saved values.~~
+ Mute button resets itself if page unfocused and focused again.
+ Mute button's and percentage text doesn't change when media is muted.
